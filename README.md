# ExtremeFusion-YOLO-LSTM-AIoT

## üß† Introduction
**ExtremeFusion** is an advanced intelligent monitoring system that integrates real-time human posture estimation, heart rate detection, and environmental sound monitoring.  
This project achieves robust and real-time multi-modal detection and analysis by combining **YOLO**, **LSTM neural networks**, **ESP32**, and sensors like **MX30105** and **MP34DT05**.

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-Time Pose Estimation** using YOLOv8, If you want a newer version, please replace the *.pt file.
- **Behavior Prediction** with LSTM Models
- **Heart Rate and Environmental Sound Monitoring** via ESP32 Sensors
- **Wi-Fi Data Transmission** for IoT integration
- **High-Efficiency Logging** and **Error Frame Capture**
- **FPS Monitoring** for Performance Analysis

## üì¶ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ExtremeFusion-YOLO-LSTM-AIoT.git
   cd ExtremeFusion-YOLO-LSTM-AIoT
   ```

2. Make sure the following models are available:
   - `yolov8n-pose.pt` (Higher versions or self-trained models can be used for pose estimation.)
   - `best.pt` (for object detection)
   - `LSTM_Model.pth` (for behavior prediction)

3. Connect your ESP32 device with MX30105 and MP34DT05 sensors.

## üèÉ Usage
Run the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

**Controls**
- Press `q` to quit the video display.

**Output**
- Real-time pose and behavior detection
- Heart rate and sound level monitoring
- Logging results to `detection_log.txt`
- Error frames are saved automatically if processing fails

## üìà Performance
- Real-time detection at **~28-30 FPS** (depending on hardware)
- Supports both **CPU** and **GPU (CUDA)** acceleration
- Automatic error recovery and resource management

## üìù Log Files
- Detection logs are automatically saved to `detection_log.txt`
- Error frames are saved as `error_frame_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg` if an exception occurs
